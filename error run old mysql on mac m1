Environment: M1 MPB, OSX 12.4

Spent a full day on this and finally came to a solution that worked.

Stop the service with brew services stop mysql@5.7

Remove the launch agent file rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql@5.7.plist

Unlink the service if it was linked brew unlink mysql@5.7

Uninstall the service brew uninstall mysql@5.7

Then I removed the mysql data directory, suggested above. This wasn't in the /usr/local/var/mysql on my machine, but rather /opt/homebrew/var/mysql

So rm -rf /opt/homebrew/var/mysql

This wasn't the last step for me. Reinstalling at this point gave me a bunch of errors and the brew post install steps failed. Most of the errors pointed to my my.cnf file. I found that removing this file before attempting to reinstall prevented those errors.

I made a backup of this file just in case this caused more issues.

cp /opt/homebrew/etc/my.cnf /opt/homebrew/etc/my.cnf.backup

Then, rm /opt/homebrew/etc/my.cnf

Note: this file may be in a different location on your machine.

Ok, now do a fresh install.

brew install mysql@5.7

brew link mysql@5.7 --force

If you link the package, you can add it to your path following the brew log suggestion. So add, export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@5.7/bin:$PATH" to your ~/.zshrc.

Verify the service is available with brew services list or brew services.

If you see mysql@5.7 there, go ahead and start it with brew services start mysql@5.7
